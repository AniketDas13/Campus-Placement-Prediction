# Campus Placement Prediction
My Industrial Training Project on 'Campus Placement Prediction' using ML with Python
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scope of this project is to determine the placement status of a student. The 'Campus Placement Prediction' model has been designed by using two classification algorithms namely Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classification. This project can be easily implemented under various situations. One can add features as and when required.
Reusability and flexibility can be exhibited in the modules. This project is extendable in ways that its original developers may not expect. The model enhances extensibility like Supervised Learning and Binary Classification.
With the advent of upgraded version of the programming language we may be able to reduce the code and simplify the understanding.

The dataset used in the project has been provided for reference:
- Jain University Bangalore Campus Placement Dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement?select=Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv
- Contains 215 student records
- Includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization
- Also includes degree specialization, type and work experience and salary offers to the placed students
- Placed (label = 1)
- Not Placed (label = 0)
- 90/10 train/test split

N.B.: The model may not achieve the best accuracy; fiddling with the various parameters may enhance it.
